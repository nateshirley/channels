### Channels

channels is a reference implementation for an on-chain friend graph. it can be used to create channel/subscriber relationships between wallets. mostly via tokens.

when new channels are created, the program links the creator's wallet to a channel token. channel tokens represent one-way connections to their creator. anyone can subscribe to any channel by minting its token via the program.

i'm going to write a bit about how it works and then i will update this. for now, feel free to ping me on twitter @yelllownate if u want to talk about it
